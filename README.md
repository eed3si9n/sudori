The word ketchup is said to derive from Hokkien word 膎汁 (kôe-chiap or kê-chiap) from southern coastal China, meaning fish sauce, which re-entered China from Vietnam in 1700s. Through trade, fish sauce also became popular in Britain where it eventually became mushroom paste. In 1800s, Americans started making it with tomatoes. In a sense, it's interesting how Cantonese dish such as sweet and sour pork incorporates ketchup into the recipe. Often made with bell peppers and pineapple and written as 咕嚕肉 (gūlōuyuhk) in Cantonese, "gulou" symbolizes the sound of rumbling stomach. In Japan, this dish is called 酢豚 (subuta), or vinegar pork, and is one of bacronyms for sbt. 酢鶏 (sudori), or vinar chicken, is a variant of subuta substituting pork with chicken.
